<h2>Mozilla Public License</h2>

<h3>Definition and details</h3>
<p>The Apache License 2.0 is rather permissive in that it lets you do much of what you might want to a product or work including copying, distributing, modifying for private or commercial use. You may use a different license for your changes but must include the original Apache License with the original portion of the work. This license also comes with a patent grant, meaning those who use or modify a work under this license also may freely use any patents associated with it.</p>

<h3>When this should be used</h3>
<p>The Apache License 2.0 should be used when you have obtained patents for the sake of others using them freely. This prevents others from similarly patenting your original idea and then disallowing others to use your idea. Using this license allows others to modify, copy and distribute a work or product while giving guarantees to the new authors to use the previous patents.</p>

<h3>Length or term of license</h3>
<p>Length of license corresponds to the workâ€™s copyright. In the USA, this is typically 70 years after the death of the creator, or 120 after it was made by an organization, at which point, the work becomes public domain.</p>

<h3>Real world examples</h3>
<ul class="bodylist">
<li>Apache httpd web server</li>
<li>Google Android operating system</li>
<li>Chef Server software (<a href="https://www.chef.io/">https://www.chef.io/</a>)</li>
<li>SVG-edit, a drawing editor of SVG files</li>
</ul>

<h3>History and shenanigans</h3>
<p>Originating in 1995, this license was a derivative of the BSD license used for the Apache httpd server software.</p>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>
<p>    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
<p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
<p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
<p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
