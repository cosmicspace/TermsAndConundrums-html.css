            <h2>Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                the ZLib/LibPNG license is not a very commonly used license, but is recognized by foss as a proper open source license.
                Containing the basic boilerplate license text, the owner of software licensed with the zlib/libpng license is absolved of any responsability for damages caused by said software.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things that makes the zlib/libpng license stand out is that it spends a lot of time discussing accrediation. It forbids the origins of the software from being misrepresented, and it encourages acknowledgement by people who use the software under this license. However, acknowledgement is not required.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Zlib/LibPNG license finds itself in a nice middle ground between very permissive licenses such as the MIT license and much more restrictive licenses such as the GPL. Many critiques of permissive licenses such as the MIT is that corporations can simply copy the exact code and resell it for profit. The clause stating that the origin cannot be misrepresented makes doing this a lot more difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                This license bears a lot of similarities to the BSD license. Some differences is that the BSD license is more restrictive with its accrediation requirements, and the BSD license is actually a family of licenses, so simply mentioning "BSD license" can be unclear about exactly what that implies.
