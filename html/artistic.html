<h2>Artistic License 2.0</h2>
<h3>Definition and details</h3>
<p>This license makes an important distinction between the version created by the author, the Standard version and other modified versions. This allows a measure of quality control for the project, since changes to the Standard version can be tested for functionality before becoming the Standard version for distribution. The unmodified Standard version can be patched with the copyright holders’ patches and updates and still be considered the Standard Version: used, copied and distributed as desired. However, once someone else modifies the code, it can no longer be distributed except for the following cases:</p>
<p>1) You provide the changes to the copyright holder, under the Artistic License, and he/she includes those changes into a new Standard version</p>
<p>2) You give the Modified version a new name and it still allows the Standard version to run correctly</p>
<p>3) You provide your source code to others when you distribute it so that they have the option of modifying it, under the same Artistic License or another equivalent license that allows copying, distribution and modification, requires the source code to be available and the same license to be used for derivative works</p>
<h3>When this should be used</h3>
<p>The main point of this license is to allow the original creator to create a Standard version of the work for quality control, but allow others to use, copy, modify and distribute their changes. These changes can be provided to the original creator to create a new Standard version, which allow improvements to be made on the work by the community. This allows a good, working Standard version to evolve, without the original author making the changes.</p>
<p>The original Artistic License (1.0) has some facets that are unclear legally and this has caused some difficulties in this license being upheld in court. Therefore, Artistic License 1.0 should not be used, in favor of the new revised Artistic License 2.0.</p>

<h3>Length or term of license</h3>
<p>Length of license corresponds to the work’s copyright. In the USA, this is typically 70 years after the death of the creator, or 120 after it was made by an organization, at which point, the work becomes public domain.</p>
<h3>Real world examples</h3>

<h3>History and shenanigans</h3>
<p>The author of the original Artistic License (1.0) is Larry Wall and it was written for Perl, a programming language, under the Perl Foundation.</p>
<p>There was some controversy surrounding the original Artistic License (1.0) in 2007. The Java Model Railroad Interface project (JMRI) used the original Artistic License (1.0) and discovered that KAM, a proprietary company, used Artistic Licensed files in one of their products and removed the copyright notices from the JMRI, which meant they were representing the code as their own work. </p>
<p>The JMRI brought the case to court and the Artistic License was ruled as a contract rather than a copyright license due to two legally ambiguous phrases. This meant that KAM could continue to distribute the software and JMRI could not pursue the higher minimum copyright infringement penalties, instead they could only receive actual damages which are considerably lower as an open source project. This essentially made the Artistic License provide no real protection for project designers. </p>
<p>As a result of this court ruling, a new version of the Artistic License has been created (2.0), with input from attorneys as well as the Perl community. This is a perfect demonstration of what can go wrong if license terms are not perfectly clear. Since the law favors those who did not draft a contract or license agreement, a license needs to be specific and spell out what everyone is allowed to do. Otherwise, the license writers may encounter situations they never expected.</p>
<p>Strangely, Perl, the project for which the Artistic License was written, can be licensed under either the Artistic License or GNU General Public License, version 1 or higher. Depending on which you choose will dictate how derivative works are handled.</p>

<p>Artistic License 2.0</p>
<p>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble<br>
********</p>
<p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.</p>
<p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.</p>
<p>Definitions<br>
***********</p>
<p>"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.</p>
<p>"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.</p>
<p>"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.</p>
<p>"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.</p>
<p>"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.</p>
<p>"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.</p>
<p>"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.</p>
<p>"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.</p>
<p>"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.</p>
<p>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>
********************************************************</p>
<p>(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.</p>
<p>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version<br>
******************************************************</p>
<p>(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form</p>
<p>of the Package. </p>
<p>(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.</p>
<p>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source<br>
**********************************************************</p>
<p>(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p>
<p>(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.</p>
<p>(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.</p>
<p>(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under</p>
<p>(i) the Original License or</p>
<p>(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.</p>
<p>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source<br>
*********************************************************************************</p>
<p>(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.</p>
<p>(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.</p>
<p>Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
**********************************</p>
<p>(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.</p>
<p>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.</p>
<p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
********************************************************</p>
<p>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.</p>
<p>General Provisions<br>
******************</p>
<p>(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.</p>
<p>(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version</p>
<p>made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure</p>
<p>that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this</p>
<p>license.</p>
<p>(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW.
