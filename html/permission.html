<h2>Permission</h2>
<p>As the second open area of copyright, this is a way to circumvent the limitations of copyright. In fact, all one has to do to have complete access to a work for their use is get permission from the copyright holder. Anything involving the work is possible after that, including modification and distribution. </p>
<p>However, this permission does not need to be free and the copyright holder can request funds in the form of royalties (a percentage of the profits from the derivative work) or a lump sum, depending on how much they deem their work to be worth. As with people in general, some are generous and some are greedy, but when the use is not under the guidelines of fair use and the work is not in the public domain, getting permission may be your only choice. </p>
<p>An extended version of permission occurs when the rights to a work are sold to another party. Where the previously mentioned permission only licenses the work for use by someone else, selling the rights changes the copyright holder to another person or organization, for a negotiated cost.</p>
<p>It is important to get permission in writing, partly so there is no confusion of what is happening, but also to protect both sides from shenanigans of forgetfulness or someone changing their mind. You wouldnâ€™t want to have a verbal agreement, only to learn things have changed when you have to go to court over it.</p>

<h3>When this should be used</h3>
<p>Getting permission aside from Copyright or whatever license is used is always a possibility. However, there could be an expense to gain this permission, so that should be considered when pursuing permissions. Furthermore, their isn't a set cost since many factors would change the amount required, such as popularity of the work, the current direction of future works, and how recent the work was released.</p>

<h3>History and shenanigans</h3>
<p>Most problems come when a work is used without permission, which can result in a lawsuit. Often, attournies of copyright holdedrs will send Cease and Desist Orders prior to taking the matter to court, in the event that the overstepping was unintentional.</p>
