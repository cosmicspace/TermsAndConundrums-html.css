<h2>BSD License</h2>
<h3>Definition and details</h3>
<p>The BSD License, specifically the 3-clause version, is a brief license that is fairly permissive. It allows modification and/or redistribution of a work or product on 2 conditions:</p>
<p>1) This license’s text must be provided for both source code and binary forms of the project</p>
<p>2) the name of the author or organization cannot be used to endorse any derivative works</p>
<p>It also provides a standard non-warranty clause for protecting authors from damage potentially caused by their work.</p>
</p>
<h3>When this should be used</h3>
<p>This license should be used when you want a brief license and are providing source that others may modify, but you don’t want them using your name to endorse their modifications. This allows you to preserve your name and reputation from others who modify your original work.</p>

<h3>Length or term of license</h3>
<p>Length of license corresponds to the work’s copyright. In the USA, this is typically 70 years after the death of the creator, or 120 after it was made by an organization, at which point, the work becomes public domain.</p>

<h3>History and shenanigans</h3>
<p>The BSD license is actually a collection of three different licenses which began in 1988. This license family was originally developed by the Regents of the University of California for the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-based operating system, from which the BSD licenses get their name. </p>
<p>The original was the 4-clause version which contained an advertising clause, meaning that previous contributors needed to be mentioned in derivative works. This made licensing quite complicated as each new contributor had to be added, at times totaling in the hundreds. Therefore, this clause was removed on July 22, 1999, resulting in the current 3-clause version, which is also called the Modified, New, or Revised BSD License. Another version is the 2-clause, or Simplified BSD License or FreeBSD License which eliminates the non-endorsement clause of the 3-clause version, as well as adds a section on the views and opinions of the authors as being separate from those of the FreeBSD project.</p>
<p>Strangely, no mention of trademark usage is mentioned in the 3-clause version of this license, even though it is explicit in stating that organization or contributor names may not be used to endorse or promote derivative works.</p>
